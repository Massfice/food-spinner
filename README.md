# üçΩÔ∏è FoodSpin

An interactive food selection application that helps users discover and choose meals through an engaging spinning wheel interface.

## What is FoodSpin?

FoodSpin is an interactive food discovery game where users **spin** to find their next meal:

-   **Food plates are arranged in a spinning wheel** - Multiple dishes rotate around a central point
-   **The center plate displays the current "winner"** - The selected dish is prominently featured in the middle
-   **Interactive spinning experience** - Hover and click the center plate to **SPIIIIIN**! üå™Ô∏è
-   **UI updates dynamically** - Price, description, and ordering options change based on the selected meal
-   **Smooth spinning animations** - Users can spin through options with directional controls

## How the Spinning Works

The core experience revolves around the satisfying spin interaction:

1. **Hover** on the central plate
2. **Click** to initiate the spin
3. **System randomizes everything**:
    - Selects a random plate as the new winner
    - Generates random spin duration
    - Randomizes "full cycles" to create that satisfying **"SPINNER GOING BRRRR"** effect
4. **Complex algorithms take over**:
    - All randomized data feeds into the movement system
    - Item positions update using delta time and `requestAnimationFrame`
    - Smooth eased animations create realistic spinning motion
5. **Animation stops** and the winner is **announced** (though it was chosen from the very beginning!)

This creates the illusion of chance while ensuring a smooth, predictable animation experience.

## Core Algorithms

The entire movement system is the core innovation of this project, featuring sophisticated mathematical calculations:

-   **Circular positioning algorithm** - Items dynamically arranged in perfect circles using trigonometry
-   **Nearest neighbor detection** - Complex angular calculations to find the closest meal option in the desired direction
-   **Movement orchestration** - Coordinated system handling spin duration, rotation counts, and directional preferences
-   **Eased animation engine** - Smooth cubic easing functions for natural, organic movement transitions
